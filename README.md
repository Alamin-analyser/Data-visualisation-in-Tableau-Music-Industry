**Objectives**

The goal of this analysis is to use the Spotify dataset to uncover trends and key insights that can be valuable for organisations looking to shape future projects, marketing strategies, or product offerings. By examining the data, we aim to identify patterns related to music genres, track characteristics, artist performance, and more, which can inform decision-making for various initiatives.

Track Characteristics by Genre:

**Create a Dashboard in Tableau:**

Once the analysis is complete, compile the findings into an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard should include key visualisations, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and trend lines, that make it easy to explore the relationships between different variables, track characteristics, and overall trends in the Spotify data. This dashboard can serve as a valuable tool for organisations to gain insights and make informed decisions based on the analysis.

**Key findings:**

•	Pop is the most popular music genre, followed by Rap.
•	The most popular artist is Drake, closely followed by Chris Brown.
•	Songs that are neither too long nor too short tend to be more popular, with the majority of popular genres falling between 3.5 to 4 minutes in length.
